# `humble-library` WIP

The repo right now is basically a massive PoC and probably isn't useful until it becomes a CLI.

## Overview

Humble has a lot of trouble with larger libraries on all platforms. Sidestepping its constraints is fairly easy thanks to [Hayden Schiff](https://www.schiff.io/) and [his great writeup on reverse-engineering the mobile app](https://www.schiff.io/blog/2017/07/21/reverse-engineering-humble-bundle-api). In the two years since that was published, there have been a few API changes that have to be taken into account, but nothing too hard to figure out.
